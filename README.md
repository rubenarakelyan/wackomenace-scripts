# wackomenace scripts

This repository contains random scripts I rescued from the old [wackomenace](https://www.wackomenace.co.uk/) site. They are mostly for historical context and probably not useful these days.

* `RSS_Content_Syndicator_210/` - phpBB plugin to expose forum posts in RSS format
* `closecomments.php` - close comments on posts that are older than a specified number of days, for Movable Type 3.x (public domain)
* `displayarray.php` - display array (echos the full contents of an array)
* `mkrdir.php` - make recursive directories (will make a whole directory tree)
* `parsedir.php` - parse directory (goes through a directory, echoing directory and file names)
* `textile2fixes.txt` - some "hacks" I made to the Textile 2 plugin for WordPress
